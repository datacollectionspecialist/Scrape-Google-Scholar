# Scrape-Google-Scholar
Learn how to scrape Google Scholar results effectively with step-by-step instructions and the best practices. Discover tools and techniques to gather academic research data efficiently.
Google Scholar is an important tool for academic researchers around the world to find and obtain literature, covering papers, monographs and conference papers in various fields. However, due to its strict anti-crawler mechanism, it is not easy to directly crawl Google Scholar data, especially for users who need large-scale data collection.

In this article, we will introduce two methods for crawling Google Scholar data: manual crawling (Scrapy/Selenium) and Scrapeless API. Manual crawling is suitable for small-scale data collection, but may encounter IP restrictions and verification code problems. Scrapeless API provides a more stable and efficient solution, especially for large-scale data crawling, without the need to maintain additional anti-detection strategies.

By comparing the advantages and disadvantages of the two methods, this article will help you choose the most suitable solution for you to achieve efficient data collection.
## Why Scrape Google Scholar?
Google Scholar provides valuable academic resources, including research papers, citations, author profiles, and more. By scraping Google Scholar, you can:
- Collect research papers on a specific topic.
- Extract citation counts for academic impact analysis.
- Retrieve author profiles and their published work.
- Automate literature reviews for research purposes.
## Challenges in Scraping Google Scholar

Scraping Google Scholar comes with challenges such as:
- CAPTCHAs: Frequent requests can trigger Google's anti-bot protection.
- IP Blocking: Google can block IPs making repeated automated requests.
- Dynamic Content: Some results may be dynamically loaded via JavaScript.

To overcome these challenges, we recommend using a dedicated API such as Scrapeless API.

## Method 1: How to Scrape Google Scholar - Traditional Web Scraping (Not Recommended)
Web scraping Google Scholar manually using Python (e.g., BeautifulSoup, Selenium) is difficult due to Google's restrictions. Example using requests:

```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=machine+learning"
headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
results = soup.find_all("div", class_="gs_r")

for result in results:
    title = result.find("h3").text if result.find("h3") else "No Title"
    print(title)


```

📌 Disadvantages:
- It is easy to trigger Google's anti-crawling mechanism, resulting in IP blocking or encountering CAPTCHA.
- The data structure is complex, and it is necessary to parse HTML and process dynamically loaded content.
- It is not suitable for large-scale data collection and has low stability.

This approach is not reliable due to Google's anti-bot measures. Instead, using an API like Scrapeless API is the best alternative.

## Method 2: Scraping Google Scholar with Scrapeless Scraping API (Recommended)
Scrapeless's Google Scholar API is a tool designed for academic research and data analysis. It can automatically crawl Google Scholar search results to obtain key information such as paper titles, authors, publication dates, and citation counts.

### Example: Fetching an Author’s Publications
Here is a code example written in Python that shows how to use the Scrapeless Google Scholar Author API to query information about academic authors:
```
import http.client
import json

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.scrapeless.com")

# Define the request payload, specify the crawler engine and author ID
payload = json.dumps({
   "actor": "scraper.google.scholar",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_scholar_author",
      "author_id": "LSsXyncAAAAJ"  # Example author ID
   }
})

# Set request headers
headers = {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

# Making a POST request
conn.request("POST", "/api/v1/scraper/request", payload, headers)

# Get the response result
res = conn.getresponse()

# Read and output data
data = res.read()
print(data.decode("utf-8"))


```
The result returned by the API request is a JSON-formatted response containing detailed information about the academic author, such as name, academic field, institution, etc. The returned data also includes a list of the author's papers and citations.

The Scrapeless Google Scholar Cite API returns a JSON structure containing two main sections: citations (citation information) and links (citation format export links). Below is a detailed analysis of each field:

**1. Citations**

This field is an array where each element represents a different citation format, including MLA, APA, Chicago, Harvard, and Vancouver. Each format includes the following fields:
| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                       |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| title      | String    | The name of the citation format, such as "MLA" or "APA"           |
| snippet    | String    | The citation text in the respective format, including article title, author, journal information, etc. |

**Example Data:**
```
"citations": [

**2. Links (Citation Export Links)**

This field is an array where each element provides a link for exporting the citation in different formats such as BibTeX, EndNote, RefMan, and RefWorks. Each format includes the following fields:
| Field Name | Data Type | Description                                                       |
|------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name       | String    | The name of the citation format, such as "BibTeX" or "EndNote"    |
| link       | String    | A URL that allows users to directly download the citation in the specified format |

**Example Data:**
```
"links": [
    {
        "name": "BibTeX",
        "link": "https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar.bib?q=info:s1QWFy06YAYJ..."
    },
    {
        "name": "EndNote",
        "link": "https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar.enw?q=info:s1QWFy06YAYJ..."
    }
]


```
**Data Analysis:**
- name: "BibTeX" indicates that this entry is a BibTeX citation export link.
- link: "https://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar.bib?q=info:s1QWFy06YAYJ..." is a direct URL to access the BibTeX citation, which can be used in LaTeX or other reference management tools.

## Scrapeless Google Scholar Profiles API
The Scrapeless Google Scholar Profiles API allows users to search for Google Scholar profiles based on author names and fetch detailed information, including citations, interests, affiliations, and more. Below is an overview of how to use the API, the parameters involved, and how to interpret the results.
### Google Scholar Profiles API Parameters

| Parameter     | Required | Description                                    |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
| engine        | TRUE     | Set to google_scholar_profiles.                |
| mauthors      | TRUE     | Author name for profile search.               |
| hl            | FALSE    | Language setting (default: en).               |
| after_author  | FALSE    | Token for pagination.                         |

### Example: Searching for an Author Profile

The following Python code demonstrates how to make an API request using the Scrapeless service:
```
import http.client
import json

conn = http.client.HTTPSConnection("api.scrapeless.com")
payload = json.dumps({
   "actor": "scraper.google.scholar",
   "input": {
      "engine": "google_scholar_author",
      "author_id": "LSsXyncAAAAJ"
   }
})
headers = {
   'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
conn.request("POST", "/api/v1/scraper/request", payload, headers)
res = conn.getresponse()
data = res.read()
print(data.decode("utf-8"))

```
The API returns a JSON object with information about the search results. Here is an example:
```

    "pagination": {
        "next": "https://scholar.google.com//citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=Mike&after_author=pnnfAUQM__8J&astart=10",
